# dragonfly-scripts

**There's not much to see here, yet.**

## What?

My collection of dragonfly Python-scripts, that I use with Dragon NaturallySpeaking.

What is Dragonfly?
* A speech recognition framework
* A Python package

[Dragonfly documentation](http://dragonfly-modules.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/command-modules/documentation/index.html)

## Why?

Due to repetitive strain injury (RSI), I started using speech recognition to be able to control my computer and especially for coding.
Dragonfly used in conjunction with Natlink, adds some powerful tools to the speech recognition program.

## Who?

I am a software engineer, lately focused mostly on web development, with Python on the backend.
I am currently running Dragon NaturallySpeaking 11, on Windows 7 64-bit.

## How?

First, I'm using [Dragon naturally speaking](http://www.nuance.com/dragon/index.htm)
for speech recognition.
Natlink and Dragonfly can be used with Windows Speech Recognition (WSR), but that is not covered here.

### Installing Natlink and Dragonfly

Python 2.6
http://sourceforge.net/projects/natlink/files/pythonfornatlink/python2.6/pythonneededfornatlink2.6.exe/download
* Self extracting zip.
* Install Pythonwin (click on, e.g., pywin32-212.win32-py2.6.exe).
* Install wxPython (click on, e.g., wxPython2.8-win32-ansi-2.8.10.1-py26.exe, extracts to a temporary folder.)
* Installing PyXML (PyXML-0.8.4.win32-py2.6.exe) is only needed if you are going to use VoiceCode

Installation of NatLink/Vocola 2/Unimacro:
http://qh.antenna.nl/unimacro/installation/installation.html
* Configuration.
* Information about common problems.

Natlink repository:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/natlink/files/natlink/

Note:
Following the instructions from the Unimacro site at antenna.nl,
when I started the "Configure Natlink Via GUI" program, I got several warning messages.
However, restarting Natlink or perhaps Dragon NaturallySpeaking, then running the configuration program again, solved that issue.

Dragonfly:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dragonfly
