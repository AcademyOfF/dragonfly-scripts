dragonfly-scripts
=================

My dragonfly scripts for Dragon NaturallySpeaking.

There's nothing to see here yet. Come back later...
---------------------------------------------------

I am currently running Dragon NaturallySpeaking 11, on Windows XP(32-bit).
I will soon try on Windows 7 64-bit.
I have been using Python 2.5 for Natlink/Dragonfly, but am switching to Python 2.6.



Installation of NatLink⁄Vocola 2⁄Unimacro:
http://qh.antenna.nl/unimacro/installation/installation.html
- Configuration.
- Information about common problems.

Python 2.6
http://sourceforge.net/projects/natlink/files/pythonfornatlink/python2.6/pythonneededfornatlink2.6.exe/download
- Self extracting zip.
- Install Pythonwin (click on, e.g., pywin32-212.win32-py2.6.exe).
- Install wxPython (click on, e.g., wxPython2.8-win32-ansi-2.8.10.1-py26.exe, extracts to a temporary folder.)
- Installing PyXML (PyXML-0.8.4.win32-py2.6.exe) is only needed if you are going to use VoiceCode

Natlink repository:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/natlink/files/natlink/

Note:
Following the instructions from the Unimacro site at antenna.nl,
when I started the "Configure Natlink Via GUI" program, I got several warning messages.
However, restarting Natlink or perhaps Dragon NaturallySpeaking, then running the configuration program again, solved that issue.

Dragonfly:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dragonfly
- Select the desired python version to install into.
